## 2.1 Threat Actors & Motivations

### Common Threat Actors

| Threat Actor    | Description                                  | Common Motivations                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Nation-state    | Government-sponsored threat actor            | Espionage, intelligence, cyber warfare |
| Script kiddie   | Low-skilled attacker using existing tools    | Curiosity, disruption, recognition     |
| Hacktivist      | Ideologically motivated attacker             | Political/philosophical causes         |
| Insider         | Person with legitimate organisational access | Revenge, financial gain, espionage     |
| Organised crime | Professionally organised criminal group      | Financial gain                         |
| Shadow IT       | Unapproved technology/services               | Convenience, productivity              |

### Common Motivations

* Financial gain
* Espionage
* Data exfiltration
* Service disruption
* Blackmail
* Political/philosophical beliefs
* Revenge
* Disruption/chaos
* Cyber warfare

# 2.2 Threat Vectors & Attack Surfaces

### Threat Vector

The method/path used by an attacker to compromise a target.

### Attack Surface

The collection of potential entry points available to an attacker.

### Common Attack Vectors

* Phishing and other message-based attacks
* Image-based attacks
* Malicious files
* Voice calls / vishing
* Removable media
* Vulnerable software
* Unsupported applications/systems
* Unsecured networks
* Open ports
* Default credentials
* Supply chain attacks
* Social engineering

### Social Engineering

Manipulates people into revealing information or performing actions.

Common techniques include:

* Authority
* Urgency
* Fear
* Trust
* Familiarity
* Impersonation
* Baiting

**Key concept:** Humans are a significant attack surface.

# 2.3 Vulnerabilities

A **vulnerability** is a weakness that can potentially be exploited by a threat actor.

### Vulnerability Categories

* Application
* Operating system
* Web-based
* Hardware
* Virtualisation
* Cloud-specific
* Supply chain
* Cryptographic
* Misconfiguration
* Mobile device
* Zero-day

### Important Examples

**SQL Injection**
Malicious SQL input is used to manipulate a database.

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
Malicious scripts are injected into content that executes in a user's browser.

**VM Escape**
An attacker escapes a virtual machine and gains access to the host.

**Misconfiguration**
A system is insecure because it has been configured incorrectly.

**Zero-Day**
A previously unknown vulnerability with no effective patch available at the time of exploitation.

# 2.4 Indicators of Malicious Activity

Indicators are signs or evidence that malicious activity may be occurring.

## Malware

* Virus
* Worm
* Trojan
* Ransomware
* Spyware
* Keylogger
* Rootkit
* Botnet

## Physical Attacks

* Device theft
* Hardware tampering
* Malicious USB devices
* Shoulder surfing
* Dumpster diving

## Network Attacks

* DoS
* DDoS
* On-path attacks
* DNS attacks
* ARP poisoning

## Application Attacks

* SQL injection
* XSS
* Buffer overflow
* Command injection
* Authentication attacks

## Password Attacks

### Brute Force

Attempts many/all possible password combinations.

### Dictionary Attack

Uses a predefined list of likely passwords.

### Password Spraying

Attempts a small number of common passwords across many accounts.

### Credential Stuffing

Uses previously compromised credentials against other services.

# 2.5 Mitigation Techniques

## Segmentation

Separates systems/networks into security zones to limit:

* Lateral movement
* Attack propagation
* Unnecessary access

## Access Control

Restricts who can access resources and what actions they can perform.

Examples:

* Authentication
* Authorisation
* RBAC
* ACLs
* MFA

## Application Allow Listing

Only approved applications are permitted to execute.

**Allow list:** Approved by default
**Block list:** Denies known unwanted items

## Isolation

Separates potentially compromised or dangerous systems from other resources.

Examples:

* Sandboxing
* Quarantine
* Isolated networks
* Virtual machines

## Patching

Applies updates that fix known vulnerabilities.

## Encryption

Protects data by converting plaintext into ciphertext.

Protects:

* Data at rest
* Data in transit

## Monitoring

Detects suspicious activity through:

* SIEM
* IDS/IPS
* Endpoint monitoring
* Log analysis
* Network monitoring

## Least Privilege

Users and systems receive only the permissions required to perform their tasks.

## Configuration Enforcement

Ensures systems follow approved security configurations and baselines.

Examples:

* Security baselines
* Group Policy
* Automated configuration
* Infrastructure as Code

## Decommissioning

Securely removes systems that are no longer required.

Important actions include:

* Revoke access
* Remove credentials
* Securely wipe data
* Remove from networks
* Update asset inventories

## Hardening

Reduces the attack surface by removing unnecessary functionality and applying secure configurations.

Examples:

* Disable unnecessary services
* Close unnecessary ports
* Remove unused software
* Change default credentials
* Apply patches
* Remove unnecessary accounts
* Enforce least privilege

| Concept        | Remember                                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Threat Actor   | **Who** is attacking?                          |
| Motivation     | **Why** are they attacking?                    |
| Threat Vector  | **How** are they attacking?                    |
| Attack Surface | **Where** can they attack?                     |
| Vulnerability  | What **weakness** exists?                      |
| Exploit        | How is the weakness **used**?                  |
| Indicator      | What **evidence** suggests malicious activity? |
| Mitigation     | How can we **reduce the risk**?                |

## Key Takeaway

Security professionals need to understand the relationship between:

**Threat Actor → Motivation → Threat Vector → Vulnerability → Attack → Indicator → Mitigation**

Understanding this chain helps identify how attacks occur and which security controls can be used to prevent, detect, or minimise their impact.
